# Frontend Development Standards

These guidelines ensure consistent frontend code across the project, focusing on styling approaches, component reuse, and TypeScript best practices.

## Styling

* **Framework:** Use Tailwind CSS for all styling needs throughout the application.

## Components

* **Reusability:** Try to reuse existing components when possible to maintain consistency.
* **New Components:** When creating new components, consider using shadcn/ui as the preferred component library.

## TypeScript

* **Type Safety:** Use TypeScript everywhere throughout the codebase.
* **Typing:** Avoid using the `any` type - always provide proper type definitions.

## Documentation

* **Code Changes:** Add a descriptive comment above any changes to explain the purpose and implementation details.
