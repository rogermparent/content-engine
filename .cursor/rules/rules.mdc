# Frontend Development Standards

These standards ensure consistency and quality across our frontend codebase.

## Technology Stack

* **Framework:** Use React for all frontend components.
* **Language:** Use TypeScript everywhere - avoid JavaScript when possible.
* **Styling:** Use TailwindCSS for all component styling.
* **Component Library:** New or rewritten components should use shadcn/ui.

## Code Quality

### Type Safety

* **Strong Typing:** All new code should be fully typed without relying on `any`.
* **Type Inference:** Prefer explicit types over relying on type inference for function parameters and return values.

### Documentation

* **Change Documentation:** Add a comment above each change describing what was modified, even if the change is already described in other text.
