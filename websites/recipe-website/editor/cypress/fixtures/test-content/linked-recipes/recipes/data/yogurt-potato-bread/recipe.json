Combine all of the ingredients and mix until cohesive. Knead the dough, by hand or mixer, until it's smooth, about 5 to 10 minutes. The dough will become fairly elastic, though it'll still be quite soft and sticky."},{"name":"","text":"Place the kneaded dough in a greased bowl or dough-rising bucket, cover it, and allow it to rise for 60 to 90 minutes, until it's quite puffy (though not necessarily doubled in bulk.)"},{"name":"","text":"To make a loaf: Shape the dough into a log, and place it in a lightly greased 9\" x 5\" loaf pan. Cover the pan with lightly greased plastic wrap, and allow the loaf to rise for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until it's crowned about 1\" over the rim of the pan."},{"name":"","text":"To make dinner rolls: Divide the dough into 24 pieces. Shape each piece into a ball, and place in a lightly greased 9\" x 13\" pan, or two 8\" or 9\" round pans. Cover the pan(s), and let the rolls rise until they're touching each other and puffy, about 60 minutes."},{"name":"","text":"To make large sandwich rolls: Divide the dough into six pieces, each about 4 1/2 ounces in weight. Roll each piece into a smooth ball, then flatten the balls (using your fingers and/or a rolling pin) until they're about 4\" in diameter. Place them on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet, about 1\" apart, and cover them with lightly greased plastic wrap. Allow the rolls to rise for 45 minutes to 1 hour (or longer, depending on the temperature of your kitchen), until they're noticeably puffy, though probably not doubled in bulk."},{"name":"","text":"While the bread or rolls are rising, preheat the oven to 350°F."},{"name":"","text":"Bake the bread for about 35 to 40 minutes, tenting it lightly with foil for the final 10 minutes; a digital thermometer inserted into the center will read about 190°F. Bake the rolls for 22 to 27 minutes, or until they're a light golden brown."},{"name":"","text":"Remove the bread or rolls from the oven, and brush with melted butter, if desired, for a soft, flavorful crust. Transfer to a rack to cool. Store cooled rolls, tightly wrapped, at room temperature for several days; freeze for longer storage."}],"image":"sour-cream-and-chive-potato-bread-or-rolls_0622.webp","date":1740254626354,"prepTime":0,"cookTime":0,"totalTime":0}
