Apply a thin layer of your favorite cooking oil (recommend olive oil) to the griddle surface and let it get good and hot. When the griddle is hot and nearly smoking, add ground beef to the griddle. Cook the ground beef, breaking it up as you go, until it is no longer pink inside. Make sure to separate as much of the burger grease from the cooked burger as possible before adding the taco seasoning. Push the excess grease into the grease trap. Toss in a couple tablespoons of taco seasoning on top of the cooked burger. Add a squirt of water to help combine the ground beef and taco seasoning, if needed. Once the taco meat is cooked, place tortilla chips on a prepared baking sheet pan or serving dish. Do this by laying a piece of parchment paper or aluminum foil onto the baking sheet and spreading a single layer of tortilla chips across the full sheet pan. Top the tortilla chips with the hot ground beef mixture, and the shredded Mexican cheese blend. If desired place the whole sheet pan with the chips, burger and cheese onto the the hot Blackstone Griddle and cover with a dome lid for about 2 - 3 minutes to melt the cheese. By doing this you are creating an oven affect and making baked nachos.\n\nWhat is the Best Way to Layer Nachos?\nLayering nachos supreme is completely customizable. Sprinkle the toppings like diced bell peppers, chopped tomatoes, and of course, a dollop of sour cream. Crunchy shredded lettuce adds a nice touch to these towering nachos. Serve hot and make sure to have a variety of side that your guests will like. \n\nVariations on this Nachos Recipe\nThis griddle grilled nachos recipe is so super easy to customize! Have fun with all your favorite toppings, including:\n\u00b7      Refried beans\n\u00b7      Sliced green olives or black olives,\n\u00b7      Pickled jalapenos\n\u00b7      Pico de Gallo\n\u00b7      Your favorite salsa\n\u00b7      Hot sauce, nacho cheese sauce, lime wedges, chopped onion, different shredded cheese combinations, fresh cilantro, \n\u00b7      And more!",
